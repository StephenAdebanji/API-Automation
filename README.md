Personal API Automation Project
#Overview

This project is designed for automated testing of APIs using modern test automation frameworks and best practices.
It helps esure that APIs function correctly, return expected responses, handle errors gracefully, and maintain reliability across deployments.

By automating API tests, we can:
1. Validate endpoints quickly and repeatedly
2. Detect regressions before release
3. Integrate API testing into CI/CD pipelines
4. Improve confidence in backend service quality

🧰 Tools and Technologies
This project uses:
Node.js – runtime environment
Playwright / Axios / Supertest – for API requests and validation
Jest / Mocha / Chai – for test assertions
Git & GitHub – for version control and collaboration
SSH or HTTPS – for secure GitHub connection
